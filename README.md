# AI-Powered Newsletter Generation System

A sophisticated AI system that generates high-quality newsletters using CrewAI and LangChain, powered by Groq's LLM API. The system employs multiple AI agents working in collaboration to research, write, and proofread content.

## Overview

This project implements an autonomous newsletter generation system using a crew of specialized AI agents:

1. **Research Agent**: Tracks and analyzes emerging technologies and breakthroughs
2. **Writer Agent**: Transforms technical research into engaging narratives
3. **Proofreader Agent**: Ensures quality and accuracy of the final content

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Groq API key
- Required Python packages (specified in pyproject.toml)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd newslatter-agents
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or use your preferred package manager
```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Groq API key:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Run the newsletter generation system:

```bash
python crew.py
```

The system will:

1. Research the specified topic using the Research Agent
2. Generate engaging content with the Writer Agent
3. Proofread and polish the content with the Proofreader Agent

## Project Structure

- `agents.py`: Defines the AI agents and their configurations
- `crew.py`: Sets up and manages the CrewAI workflow
- `tasks.py`: Defines the specific tasks for each agent
- `tools.py`: Contains custom tools used by the agents
